# The_G.O.A.T_Company
The **G.O.A.T app** is a platform designed to establish a mutually beneficial partnership between investors and small-scale goat farmers in India. 
This platform is a simple route which allows investors to provide the necessary capital for farmers to purchase and raise goats, while ensuring transparency and security through several comprehensive features. This platform provides goat farmers direct contact to interested customers, outside the general scope of their go-to market.
The app is tailored to the needs of existing goat farmers and provides scope for anyone to invest in a multi-crore industry which contributes to a significant portion of Indiaâ€™s GDP.
