# The_G.O.A.T_Company

The G.O.A.T app is a platform designed to establish a mutually beneficial partnership between investors and small-scale goat farmers in India. The app is tailored to the needs of existing goat farmers and provides scope for anyone to invest in a multi-crore industry that contributes significantly to Indiaâ€™s GDP.

# The problem statement

Small farmers face significant challenges in accessing capital to expand their goat farming operations, impacting their profitability and the overall supply of goat products.

In addition to limited exposure to solo investors, another major problem faced by goat farmers in India is low accessibility to market prices and information. They often rely on a limited local market, which can lead to price manipulation.

# How The G.O.A.T app solves this issue

This platform offers a simple route for investors to provide the necessary capital for farmers to purchase and raise goats while ensuring transparency and security through several comprehensive features. It also provides goat farmers with direct contact with interested customers, extending beyond their usual local market.
