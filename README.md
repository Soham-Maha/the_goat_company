# The_G.O.A.T_Company
The **G.O.A.T app** is a platform designed to establish a mutually beneficial partnership between investors and small-scale goat farmers in India. 
The app is tailored to the needs of existing goat farmers and provides scope for anyone to invest in a multi-crore industry which contributes to a large portion of Indiaâ€™s GDP.
# The problem statement

Small farmers face significant challenges in accessing capital to expand their goat farming operations, impacting their profitability and the overall supply of goat products.

Along with limited exposure to solo investors, another major problem faced by goat farmers in India is low  accessibility to market prices and information. They stick to a particular within reach market which often leads to manipulation of prices.

# How The G.O.A.T app solves this issue

This platform is a simple route which allows investors to provide the necessary capital for farmers to purchase and raise goats, while ensuring transparency and security through several comprehensive features. This simple route also provides goat farmers direct contact to interested customers, outside the general scope of their go-to market.
